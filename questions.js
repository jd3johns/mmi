    "question": "A 2 year old infant has lost a massive amount of blood in a road accident and again the best chance of saving the child's life is an urgent blood transfusion and operative intervention to arrest the bleeding. Both the child's parents are Jehovah's Witnesses and refuse to give permission for a blood transfusion, requesting instead that the best available non-blood products are used to restore volume and that surgery is carried out without blood. They understand that this will be a far more dangerous course of action than surgery plus blood transfusion but persist in refusing permission for a blood transfusion for their child.
